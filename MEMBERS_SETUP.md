# Members Section Setup Guide

## Overview
The members section has been successfully integrated with your existing Supabase database. Users can now:

- Sign in with email (magic link)
- View subscription status and usage
- Upgrade their plans
- Manage account settings

## What's Implemented

### ✅ Authentication
- Email-based authentication using Supabase
- Magic link sign-in (no passwords needed)
- Member login button in header
- Protected members dashboard route

### ✅ Dashboard Features
- Account overview with subscription tier
- Usage tracking (recordings, minutes, exports, storage)
- Subscription status and expiry date
- Upgrade modal with Pro/Premium plans

### ✅ UI Components
- Responsive design matching your existing style
- Mobile-friendly navigation with auth
- Progress bars for usage limits
- Modern card-based layout

## Next Steps: Stripe Integration

To complete the payment functionality:

### 1. Install Stripe Dependencies
```bash
pnpm add stripe @stripe/stripe-js
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Add to your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### 3. Stripe Dashboard Setup
1. Create products for Pro ($9.99/month) and Premium ($19.99/month)
2. Update price IDs in `lib/stripe.ts`
3. Set up webhook endpoint: `/api/webhooks/stripe`

### 4. Database Updates
Consider adding these columns to `profiles`:
```sql
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN stripe_customer_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN stripe_subscription_id TEXT;
```

## File Structure
```
components/
├── auth/
│   └── auth-modal.tsx          # Login/signup modal
├── subscription/
│   └── upgrade-modal.tsx       # Plan upgrade UI
└── header.tsx                  # Updated header with auth

contexts/
└── auth-context.tsx           # Authentication state management

lib/
├── supabase.ts                # Supabase client & types
└── stripe.ts                  # Stripe integration (placeholder)

app/
└── members/
    └── page.tsx               # Protected dashboard
```

## Testing
1. Start dev server: `pnpm run dev`
2. Click "Member Login" in header
3. Enter your email and check for magic link
4. Access `/members` to view dashboard
5. Test upgrade modal (shows placeholder for now)

## Security Notes
- All routes are properly protected
- Supabase RLS policies should be configured
- Environment variables are properly secured
- Magic links provide passwordless security
